# Smart Greenhouse Application
Nowadays, many projects are developed and implemented in the field of Internet of Things. Life has become smarter with developed projects. One of these projects is the Smart Greenhouse project used in agriculture. The Smart Greenhouse Project aim to being helpful to the user in the field of agriculture. The user can see the necessary data in the environment where the greenhouse is located and can remotely control the operations to be performed. In the Smart Greenhouse Project, mobile and web interfaces have been developed for the user to follow and control the status of the environment. NodeMCU Lolin Esp8266 Wifi Development Card was used as the card to access this data to the user, and the relevant sensor, pump, motor and connection tools were also used. Blynk application was preferred in the mobile part.
